# Overview
For this project I will be analysing some Ecommerce dataset. The code uses multiple libraries to perform summary statistics,
data visualisations and linear regression to provide insight on whether or not the company should focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website.  

# Dependencies
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Seaborn
4. Sklearn

# The dataset contains the following fields:

* Avg. Session Length: Average session of in-store style advice sessions.
* Time on App: Average time spent on App in minutes
* Time on Website: Average time spent on Website in minutes
* Length of Membership: How many years the customer has been a member.
